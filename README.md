## WordReference Translation Lookup

This is a helper bookmarklet to let you easily lookup a word on the WordReference dictionary.
This could be used by translators who need extra references from various dictionaries.

‚úÖ This will also work on other websites, not just Seedlang.

### Usage

1. Highlight the word you want to lookup
2. Click the bookmarklet
3. A new window should open in your browser with a dictionary lookup.

### Select Language

You need to configure the bookmarklet before you can use it:

1. Open [wordref_translation_lookup.js](./wordref_translation_lookup.js)
2. Find the part of the text that says `REPLACE_ME`
3. Replace `REPLACE_ME` with the language combo you need, for example for English to Greek you would set `engr`. <br>
   You can identify the exact language codes by selecting the dictionary you want at https://wordreference.com and looking at the URL.<br>
   Some examples:
    - English -> Greek (`engr`): https://www.wordreference.com/engr/
    - German -> Spanish (`dees`): https://www.wordreference.com/dees/
    - English synonyms: https://www.wordreference.com/synonyms/

## Bookmarklets in other browsers

I have not tested other browsers, but the process should be similar to the above.

## Limitations

- This is in no way supported by the official Seedlang app.
- It relies on the Seedlang app not changing its web interface (which it occasionally does). In that case these utils might break, with unexpected results.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **When you retire a review you do not get any points**. Please take this into account before you go into a retirement spree üî•
