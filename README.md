# Retire Review Bookmarklet

This is a helper bookmarklet to let you easily retire review cards with a single click.

It is meant to be used during [reviews](https://www.seedlang.com/reviews/decks/review) on [seedlang.com](https://www.seedlang.com).

I have not tested other browsers, but the process should be similar to the above.

You should now be able to click your bookmark to retire the curently visible card.
