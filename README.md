## Retire Review Bookmarklet

This is a helper bookmarklet to let you easily retire review cards with a single click.

It is meant to be used during [reviews](https://www.seedlang.com/reviews/decks/review) on [seedlang.com](https://www.seedlang.com).

### Installation

#### Firefox

- **Right click** on your bookmarks bar (if it's not visible, [see here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox#w_how-to-turn-on-the-bookmarks-toolbar)).
- Select **"New Bookmark..."**
- Give the bookmark a *Name*, like `Retire Review`
- In the *Location* field, paste the code found in [retire_review.js](./bookmarklets/retire_review.js).<br>
  Make sure you select the entire line, and that it's all in one line.
- Click **Add**

#### Chrome

- **Right click** on your bookmarks bar (if it's not visible, [see here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842)).
- Select **"Add Page..."**
- Give the bookmark a *Name*, like `Retire Review`
- In the *URL* field, paste the code found in [retire_review.js](./bookmarklets/retire_review.js).<br>
  Make sure you select the entire line, and that it's all in one line.
- Click **Save**

#### Other Browsers

I have not tested other browsers, but the process should be similar to the above.

You should now be able to click your bookmark to retire the curently visible card.

## Limitations

- This is in no way supported by the official Seedlang app.
- It relies on the Seedlang app not changing its web interface (which it occasionally does). In that case these utils might break, with unexpected results.
- ⚠️ When you retire a review **you do not get any points**. Please take this into account before you go into a retirement spree 🔥
